                                    The Alien Invasion Game
    This game is about shooting down ships perceived to be alien ships your goal is to make sure you take 
    down all ships with limited number of ships available to you and the challenge increases as you progress.
    You can adjust the settings file to your specification. But other files remain untouched. Adjustment to other files should
    only be done  by a professional. only values in settings should be adjusted.
    NB. Variable names should not be changed as this may lead to malfunctioning of the software application.


    Usage: You can lunch the game by typing from your terminal python3 alien_invasion.py or python alien_invasion.py
            depending on the python interpreter installed on your system.
    Note : This game is automated to run on fullscreen mode so adjustment to screen_width and height in settings might not work you can check for other versions of the game that allows for user screen manipulations from pontex lab: Soon to be released
    Owing to the fact that the game is fullscreen automated you have to press "q" on your keyboard to quit as this is the only way to close the python window that will be automatically created  by lunching this game.
